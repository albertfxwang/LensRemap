remapping multiple images detected in the field of MACS0717

<<<140727>>> naming conventions:
    1. "src plane img"/"lens plane img" refer to the surface brightness (SB) profiles of distant galaxies on the src/lens
plane.

    2. "src"/"img" are the short-form equivanlences of item 1. So if "img" is used independently (from "plane"), it
refers to SB profile on the lens plane.
