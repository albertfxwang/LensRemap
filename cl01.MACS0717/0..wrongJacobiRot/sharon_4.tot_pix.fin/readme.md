<<<140729>>> NOTE: the srcpix of system 4 is derived by a wrong formula of Jacobi matrix. I accidently used kappa_ext *
                   eye(2) rather than the correct one (1-kappa_ext) * eye(2) to do the calculation. Now this error has
                   been corrected. No other erroneous srcpix processes are inflicted by this.
